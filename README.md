- ✅ Full CRUD operations on trails, users, features
- ✅ Authentication integration with external API
- ✅ Role-based visibility (full/limited)
- ✅ Many-to-many relationship (trails-features)
- ✅ Audit trail logging
- ✅ RESTful API with Swagger documentation

## Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Python 3.x, Flask, Connexion
- **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server
